          Baptist Voice Bible College, also known as BVBC, is a private school
          that offers foundational and higher education. It has been operated
          and managed by Grace Baptist Church since 2000. The Basic Education
          Department utilizes the Accelerated Christian Education system that
          was started in the early 1970s by dedicated parents who desired
          their children reared under the teaching of God's word - the Bible.
          A.C.E. penetrated over 130 countries, where parents desire their
          children's lives patterned after the timeless principles of God's
          Word. <br /><br />

          Department of Education-Region IV-A has given full recognition to
          BVBC: Junior High School (years 7-10) since 2023, Elementary (Grades
          1 through 6) since 2017, and Pre-Elementary (Kindergarten ) since
          2016, as well as a permit to operate the Senior High School
          (Academic Track) since 2018.<br /><br />

          On the other hand, the College Department offers a Bachelor in
          Theology and a Bachelor of Science in Christian Education. The
          commitment of dedicated staff and diligent students in these
          departments has bridged the Licensure Examination for Teachers with
          100% marks for three consecutive undertakings.

                Rooted in Faith. Growing with Purpose. <br>

                Founded in 2000 by Grace Baptist Church, Baptist Voice Bible College (BVBC) began as a ministry to
                provide Christ-centered education anchored in the Bible. Through the years, BVBC has grown from a small

                With milestones such as government recognition for our Kindergarten, Elementary, and Junior High
                programs, and a 100% passing rate in the Licensure Examination for Teachers, BVBC continues to build a
                lasting legacy—shaping lives for God's glory.
