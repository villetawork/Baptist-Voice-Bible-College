                Rooted in Faith. Growing with Purpose. <br>

                Founded in 2000 by Grace Baptist Church, Baptist Voice Bible College (BVBC) began as a ministry to
                provide Christ-centered education anchored in the Bible. Through the years, BVBC has grown from a small
                school to a fully recognized institution offering quality basic and higher education. <br>

                With milestones such as government recognition for our Kindergarten, Elementary, and Junior High
                programs, and a 100% passing rate in the Licensure Examination for Teachers, BVBC continues to build a
                lasting legacy—shaping lives for God's glory.
